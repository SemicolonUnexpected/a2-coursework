A2 Coursework, yay!

# Todo

- Use SVG lib to draw graphics
- Figure out how to open print dialogue
- Actually do the colour scheme an don't just steal one
- Use PDF lib to edit and render PDFs

# Things that are semi-fixed (i.e. I don't know what went wrong, but its gone now)

- Textbox focus - what the sigma - makes no sense whatsoever. Play about with when a textbox is focused

# Things which are fixed in a janky way

- Flashing of controls as they load?? No problem - just stick a big panel infront with one colour and Winforms can somehow render them behind??? - Sounds like inefficient painting to me

# Things which are actually fixed

- None ;)

# Ideas

- Make a theme transition to avoid flicker
