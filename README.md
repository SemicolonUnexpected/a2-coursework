A2 Coursework, yay!

## Todo

- Decide on best way to do db query

## Things that are semi-fixed (i.e. I don't know what went wrong, but its gone now after some code that i dont trust)

- Textbox focus - what the sigma - makes no sense whatsoever. Play about with when a textbox is focused

## Things which are fixed in a janky way

- Flashing of controls as they load?? No problem - just stick a big panel infront with one colour and Winforms can somehow render them behind??? - Sounds like inefficient painting to me

## Things which are actually fixed

- None ;)

## Ideas

- Make a theme transition to avoid flicker
- Update login attempt db to include connection errors
- Add periodic password reset requirements

- login timeout and login logging
- when a user logs in for the first time, they should be prompted to update their emergency details (in a widget)
